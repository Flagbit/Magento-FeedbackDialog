Magento-FeedbackDialog
======================
This extension displays an interferer to the shop's visitors, which pops up and darkens the rest of the page content by clicking. The interferer can provide important information, special promotions or, as in our case, a newsletter subscription.
After implementation, the extension can be activated through the backend under Configuration -> Customers -> Newsletters.
